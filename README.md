# Processing in Java in VS Code

Welcome to Processing in Java in Visual Studio Code, a sample project to help you get started.

Based on [Processing in Java](https://happycoding.io/tutorials/java/processing-in-java).

## Getting Started

1. Install [Processing](https://processing.org)
2. Install [Language Support for Java(TM) by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.java).
3. If not on macOS, adapt the referenced Processing library path in `.vscode/setting.json`
4. Run it

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
